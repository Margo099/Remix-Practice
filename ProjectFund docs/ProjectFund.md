# ProjectFund
Smart contract for project donations on Solidity

## Overview
ProjectFund is a decentralized application (dApp) smart contract designed to facilitate donations to different projects.  
It allows users to contribute ETH to projects securely and transparently without intermediaries.

The main goals of the project:
- Simplify the donation process.
- Ensure transparency and traceability of all transactions.
- Improve accessibility for project owners to receive funding.

## Features
- 🔒 **Secure ETH Transfers** — Safe handling of users' funds.
- 🗂️ **Project Registration** — Ability to create and manage multiple projects.
- 💰 **Donations Handling** — Anyone can donate to any active project.
- 📄 **Transparent History** — Every donation is recorded on-chain.
- 🔓 **Open Smart Contract** — Full logic is open and verifiable.

## Smart Contract Details
- Written in Solidity
- Includes project creation, donation, and balance tracking
- Modular and extendable structure

## How to Use
1. Deploy the smart contract to the Ethereum test network.
2. Register your project by providing a name and description.
3. Share the project address with potential donors.
4. Track received donations via the blockchain.

## Technologies Used
- Solidity
- Hardhat (for development and deployment)
- OpenZeppelin Contracts (for best security practices)

## Future Improvements
- Adding deadline functionality for fundraising
- Allowing refunds if fundraising goals are not met
- Multi-token donations (ERC-20 support)
- Ethers.js (for front-end integration)
